# GitHub Upload Checklist

## 📋 Pre-Upload Steps

### 1. Clean Up
- [ ] Remove any API keys, tokens from code
- [ ] Check for hardcoded paths (replace with relative paths or args)
- [ ] Delete large model files (or use Git LFS)
- [ ] Remove temporary/cache files

### 2. Verify .gitignore
- [ ] Check `.gitignore` includes:
  - `*.pth`, `*.pt` (model files)
  - `models/`, `florence_models/` (checkpoint dirs)
  - `.venv/`, `venv/` (virtual envs)
  - `__pycache__/` (Python cache)
  - `*.token`, `.env` (secrets)

### 3. Test Locally
- [ ] Create fresh virtual environment
- [ ] Install from `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Run `python efficientnet/train.py --help` (check no errors)
- [ ] Run `python florence/train.py --help` (check no errors)

### 4. Documentation Review
- [ ] README.md complete with project overview
- [ ] Each module has its own README
- [ ] QUICK_START.md has working commands
- [ ] License file added (if applicable)

## 🚀 GitHub Upload Process

### Option 1: GitHub Desktop (Easiest)

1. **Download GitHub Desktop**
   - https://desktop.github.com/

2. **Create Repository**
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - File → New Repository
   - Name: `disaster-classification`
   - Local Path: Your project folder
   - Initialize with README: No (you already have one)
   - Git Ignore: None (you already have .gitignore)
   - Click "Create Repository"

3. **Initial Commit**
   - GitHub Desktop will show all files
   - Write commit message: "Initial commit: EfficientNet & Florence-2 disaster classification"
   - Click "Commit to main"

4. **Publish to GitHub**
   - Click "Publish repository"
   - Choose public or private
   - Click "Publish Repository"

### Option 2: Command Line (Git)

1. **Initialize Git**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\abdal\OneDrive - Zewail City of Science and Technology\Desktop\Nile internship\Final Code"
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: EfficientNet & Florence-2 disaster classification"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `disaster-classification`
   - Don't initialize with README (you have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```powershell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/disaster-classification.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Upload via GitHub Web (Simple)

1. **Create Repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `disaster-classification`
   - Public or Private
   - Don't initialize with README
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Upload Files**
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop your entire project folder
   - Commit changes
   - Done!

## ⚠️ Security Checklist (IMPORTANT!)

Before uploading, ensure you've removed:

- [ ] ❌ Hugging Face tokens (format: `hf_xxxxx...`)
- [ ] ❌ API keys or passwords
- [ ] ❌ Absolute paths with your username
- [ ] ❌ Large model files (>100MB without Git LFS)
- [ ] ❌ Personal data in comments or debug prints

**If you accidentally committed secrets:**
1. Invalidate the token immediately on Hugging Face
2. Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
3. Force push to GitHub (only after cleaning history)
